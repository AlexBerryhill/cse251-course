## Channels

Communication is divided into channels. Most of our class-wide communication will happen in the **#general** channel.  Post general questions to the class.  However, this is not a place to post code for assignments that you are working on.

In addition, you can send direct messages (ie., chats) to your instructor (or to other students). In fact, if you have a pressing question about something, you can often get a response faster by sending a direct message to the instructor than by emailing.


## Etiquette

It's important to be professional in your online communications. Aside from the standard guidelines of not using ALL-CAPS TO COMMUNICATE and speaking respectfully.  Please do no post assignment code on the course group.
