# Directory Structure used in the Course


This is the suggested directory structure for the course.  The example below has `cse251` as the main folder for the course.  The reason for this structure is to ensure that the cse251 library, `cse251.py`, can be found by your code (and when your assignments are being graded).

Note: you need to open the assignment or team folder that you are working on in VSCode for the editor to compile and run your code.  Just opening the top main folder will have issues with path locations in your code.
