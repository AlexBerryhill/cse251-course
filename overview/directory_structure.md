# Directory Structure used in the Course


This is the suggested directory structure for the course.  The example below has `cse251` as the main folder for the course.  

Note: you need to open the assignment or team folder that you are working on in VSCode for the editor to compile and run your code.  Just opening the top main folder will have issues with path locations in your code.

```text
cse251 (or what ever you want)

  - week02
    - assignment

  - week03
